# hugin-multiscan
 VERY SIMPLE c++ code to generate linux shell script that executes panorama stitching of multiple flat images with hugin/panotools

adapt path string on line 11, set number of images and then compile and run. Make sure your machine allows the output file's execution as a program.

based on files from http://hugin.sourceforge.net/tutorials/scans/en.shtml, but facilitates handling of multiple images.
